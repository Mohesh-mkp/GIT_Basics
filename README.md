# GIT_Basics
## Introduction   
- Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development.   
- It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become the standard version control system for many projects.   
- It is free and open-source software and is known for its speed, flexibility, and ability to handle both small and large projects.

## A Few things to know about GIT
- __Repository:__ It is a folder where subfolders or files related to the project are being stored. We can add multiple files and multiple folders to repos.
- __Init:__ It is an action on a folder or directory that is present on the local system. When work related to a project is done on the local system this **init** command will initialize the folder to git. That means it will initialize the folder or directory as a branch or main repository. (Then after configuration of mail and username and after creating a new repository on GitHub, we can copy the repo path and remotely add the path to interlink the repo as main or sub-branch) 
-__Status:__ This command is used to check the status of the directory if any files are modified or untracked.
- __Add:__ This command of git is used to add the folder to the Github repo.
- __Commit:__ This command is used to save the changes with the proper description as a message.
- __Clone:__ As per the name, it is an action by git where the entire repository or subfolders can be duplicated and stored in locally.
- __Branch:__ It is similar to branches of tree. We can create multiple branches to not disturb the original file and we can work independently to others actions. For example, multiple developers are working on a single project and so are the testers team, this branch facility will give space to the individual developers to work on their assigned tasks which are not relevant to others, and no need to wait for their completion.
- __Push:__ As the name states, the command is executed to send the local folder to the GitHub directory with the respective subfolder and files.
- __Pull:__ As the name states, the command is executed to retrieve the repo from the GitHub directory to the local system with the respective subfolder and files.
